# Todo list
Todo list is a simple Progressive Web App.

## How to use
The way this Todo List app works is pretty simple. Type in a task or item or whatever you want into the input field and press 'SAVE ITEM' (or hit Enter). Once you've submitted your item, you will see it appear as an entry. You can keep adding item to add additional entries and have them all show up
To remove an item, just click on a removing icon for existing entry. That entry will be removed. The same way for toggle status 'done'. Also you can edit existing item by double click.

## Current features
Main functionality of Todo list application:

- adding items
- toggling status 'done' for items
- displaying items
- removing items

## Enhancemenets
Tasks to complete:

- When adding an item, add a promise with a random delay between 500ms to 1000ms to mimic an API call. Take into account further actions like disabling the button and adding a loading animation.
- When deleting an item, please add a confirmation prompt.
- Allow the user to select multiple items for deletion.
